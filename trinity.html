<h2>What Do I like About Trinity?</h2>

<p>The features about Trinity that I appreciate most are the numerous studying environments one can find readily on campus and summer research opportunities. From bookable rooms in Coates Library to spacious computer labs in the newly-renovated Center for Sciences & Innovation, I am sure I can find a place to be productive. I can also look forward to gaining invaluable research on-campus, where I may lay the foundations of knowledge that will help contribute to my future success in a graduate career.</p>
<p>I chose Trinity University because it offered a comfortable learning experience, wherein small class sizes and respected professors allow each student to build connections and understand academic material more clearly.</p>

<h2>My Path</h2>

<p>I chose to be a chemistry major both because I feel that it is the perfect avenue for me to explore my own interests but also because I would be directly contributing to human knowledge through my graduate education.
